# Malek's Mission

Malek was sent to spy on King Ghast, and he found a factory and it was making a headless robot. He said, "Is that Herobrine's robot body?"

At my base...

We went to a farm to to get food. I got food from a cow, but everyone else said the cow was a spy. The cow overheard us talking about Malek and ran away. The cow came to a temple and talked to the slaves to deliver the information that it had learned. It was a spy trained to deliver secret messages.

Malek's trip back to my base took twice as long as usual because he had to avoid all the bad guys who were trying to capture him thanks to the cow spy. Once Malek go back he told me about the important information and data he'd discovered. He had learned that King Ghast's plan was to travel to a different reality.
