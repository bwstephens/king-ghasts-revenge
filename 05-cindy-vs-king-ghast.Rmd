# Cindy vs King Ghast

Cindy wanted to get Herobrine back but King Ghast wanted to stay on the throne. Everyone disagreed with King Ghast, so Cindy was now in charge. King Ghast was overthrown. 

Cindy finished Herobrine's robot body and Herobrine's stolen skull was put on. It would take a few hours for him to come back to life. Now Cindy had to distract me so I wouldn't destroy Herobrine before he came back to life. Cindy got Will, Elder, and King Ghast and went to find me.
